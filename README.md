### What I learned

I haven't used grid in a long time, and I had a hard time trying to make it responsive and arranging the cards. Also it took me a while to figure out how to make it responsive, cause I was setting the media queries right, but I had set the width and height, and that wasn't letting the items to adjust in lower resolutions.

Also I tried to use variables in CSS this time, just to get me use to use them, it's easier but I still need practice to know how to use them properly.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped to remember a couple of things, and even when I know I know something, I still double-check it, it's the best guide. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
